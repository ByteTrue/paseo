Run agents in parallel on your own machines. Ship from your browser or your desk.

- **Self-hosted:** Agents run on your machine with your full dev environment. Use your tools, your configs, and your skills.
- **Multi-provider:** Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, OpenCode, and Pi through the same interface. Pick the right model for each job.
- **Voice control:** Dictate tasks or talk through problems in voice mode. Hands-free when you need it.
- **Cross-surface:** Desktop, browser, and CLI. Start work at your desk, check in from your phone browser, script it from the terminal.
- **Privacy-first:** Paseo doesn't have any telemetry, tracking, or forced log-ins.

## Getting Started

Paseo runs a local server called the daemon that manages your coding agents. Clients like the desktop app, web app, and CLI connect to it.

### Prerequisites

You need at least one agent CLI installed and configured with your credentials:

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
- [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli/)
- [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode)
- [Pi](https://pi.dev)

### Desktop app (recommended)

Download it from [paseo.sh/download](https://paseo.sh/download) or the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/releases). Open the app and the daemon starts automatically. Nothing else to install.

To connect from another device, open the web app in your browser and paste the pairing link shown in Settings.

### CLI / headless

Install the CLI and start Paseo:

```bash
npm install -g @bytetrue/cli
paseo
```

This is useful for servers and remote machines.

For full setup and configuration, see:

- [Docs](https://paseo.sh/docs)
- [Configuration reference](https://paseo.sh/docs/configuration)

## CLI

Everything you can do in the app, you can do from the terminal.

```bash
paseo run --provider claude/opus-4.6 "implement user authentication"
paseo run --provider codex/gpt-5.4 --worktree feature-x "implement feature X"

paseo ls                           # list running agents
paseo attach abc123                # stream live output
paseo send abc123 "also add tests" # follow-up task

# run on a remote daemon
paseo --host workstation.local:6767 run "run the full test suite"
```

See the [full CLI reference](https://paseo.sh/docs/cli) for more.

## Skills

Skills teach your agent to use Paseo to orchestrate other agents.

```bash
npx skills add getpaseo/paseo
```

Then use them in any agent conversation:

- `/paseo-handoff` — hand off work between agents.
- `/paseo-loop` — loop an agent against clear acceptance criteria.
- `/paseo-advisor` — spin up a single agent as an advisor for a second opinion.
- `/paseo-committee` — form a committee of two contrasting agents for planning and root-cause analysis.

## Development

Quick monorepo package map:

- `packages/server`: Paseo daemon (agent process orchestration, WebSocket API, MCP server)
- `packages/app`: Expo web client + shared Electron renderer
- `packages/cli`: `paseo` CLI for daemon and agent workflows
- `packages/desktop`: Electron desktop app
- `packages/relay`: Relay package for remote connectivity
- `packages/website`: Marketing site and documentation (`paseo.sh`)

Common commands:

```bash
npm run dev
npm run dev:server
npm run dev:app
npm run dev:desktop
npm run dev:website
npm run build:server
npm run typecheck
```
